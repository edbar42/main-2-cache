# Main to Cache
> **The program is unfinished and was mainly a way for me to test my skills in C. Some of the requirements couldn't be met within the deadline and the code is pretty messy because I didn't yet know how to make multifile projects in C. Still it was fun, and I am leaving it here just for showcasing.**

This program mimics the exchange of information between main memory and a CPU's cache. It was developed for a class project in Computer Architecture. 

All cache memory operations are logged to the screen. Main memory operations are written to different log files.
